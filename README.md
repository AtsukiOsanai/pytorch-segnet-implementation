# pytorch-semseg-implementation  
This repository is for personal study about semantic-segmentation.  
Many parts of here refers to meetshah1995/pytorch-semseg repository.  
https://github.com/meetshah1995/pytorch-semseg.git  
Threfore, I recommend to clone reopository above instead of this repository.
